# Odd or Even Number Checker
This program checks whether a given number is odd or even and outputs the result to the console.


## Overview
This program prompts the user to input an integer and determines whether the number is odd or even. It uses basic input/output functions from the C standard library.

## Prerequisites
- A C compiler such as gcc (GNU Compiler Collection).

- A terminal or command prompt for running compilation and execution commands.

- Familiarity with basic terminal commands is recommended.

### Compilation Instructions
Save the source code to a file named odd_even.c or any .c filename of your choice.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your file is located.

Compile the program using the following command:


`gcc odd_even.c -o odd_even`

1 gcc: The compiler command.

2 odd_even.c: The C source code file.
3 -o odd_even: Specifies the name of the output executable.

After running the command, an executable file named odd_even will be generated in the same directory.

### Running the Program
Ensure the executable file odd_even exists in the current directory.

Run the program using the following command:

`./odd_even`

Follow the on-screen instructions to input a number.

``Example
$ ./odd_even
Enter a number: 4
The number is an even number``

``Input: 7
$ ./odd_even
Enter a number: 7
The number is an odd number``
